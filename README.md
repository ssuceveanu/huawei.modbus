Homey app to receive realtime data from your SolarEdge, Growatt, Sungrow, Huawei, Solax & Wattsonic solar installation using local Modbus TCP

On this fork is for multiple Huawei invertors and batterys.
Not working yet.

## Purpose
The difference of this app and the already existing solar panels app is that this app reads the data directly from the inverter.
The SolarEdge api is only limited to 300 calls/ day, so you get only updates every 10-15 minutes.

The modbus app receives data every few seconds.
If you have an energy monitor installed you can maximize your self-consumption and limit your exported power by using it. You can make flows based on your generated solar power, exported power, imported power or current power consumption.

The iOS / android app from SolarEdge or Growatt are fine, so it is not the purpose to create this app again.

## Supported devices
Following devices are supported
- Inverters with SetApp and with display
- Modbus energy Meter
- Storedge devices (DC connected battery storage)
- Growatt - SPA, SPH or TL-X XXX Hybrid Inverter and others in the same range
- Wattsonic gen3 inverter and their clones (sunways, solinteg, A-Tronix, St-ems)
- Sungrow Hybrid with battery
- Huawei Hybrid with battery
- Solax with battery

## Inverters
Modbus TCP is disabled by default on all inverters, you have to enable this function
Important: The TCP server idle time is 2 minutes after starting. In order to leave the connection open, the request should be made
within 2 minutes. The connection can remain open without any MODBUS requests.

## Solaredge Inverters with SetApp
Enable wifi direct on the inverter. Connect to the inverter access point like you would for a normal wifi network. The wifi password is published at the right side of the inverter. Then open up a browser and go to http://172.16.0.1 . From this webpage you can enable modbus TCP without setApp or installer account.

## Solaredge Inverters with display (without SetApp)
Your CPU firmware has to be at least v 3.xxxx, if this is not the case, upgrade your firmware.

Go to the menu by the following steps:
- Long press the 'OK' button for a few seconds
- Release the 'OK' button
- The screen will ask a password, this is '12312312' (the 2nd button from the left is '1', the 3rd button is '2', etc...)
- Go to Communication --> LAN Conf --> Modbus TCP (the default port is 502).
- To modify the TCP port, select Modbus TCP --> TCP Port, set the port number and long-press Enter
